# App Features

## Overview

- **Top Navigation Bar** (Green Header)
- **Sidebar** (Data Controls on the left)
- **Main Panel** (Central Content area) 

Understanding these sections helps you select, filter, and extract DHIS2 data efficiently.

## Top Navigation Bar

The Navigation Bar spans the top of the app.
It include:

- Three navigation tabs: `Service Data`, `Population Data` and `Countdown Data`.

### Service Data Tab: 

Use this tab to retrieve monthly service data.

- Select data elements from DHIS2
- Filter by period, organisation level, or unit
- View and download structured data tables

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","service-tab.jpeg"))
# library(knitr)
# opts_chunk$set(list(echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE))
```

### Population Data Tab

Used for downloading population data or other yearly indicators.

- Allows selection of elements organized by year
- Functions similarly to Service Data but on an annual scale

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","population-tab.jpeg"))
# library(knitr)
# opts_chunk$set(list(echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE))
```

### Countdown Tab

Enables extraction of Countdown indicators.

- Maps DHIS2 data elements to Countdown indicators
- Downloads mapped data and structure for portability
- Exports Excel file preformatted for Countdown data analysis

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","countdown-tab.jpeg"))
# library(knitr)
# opts_chunk$set(list(echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE))
```

### Context Information

Located on the top-right.

- Shows logged-in username
- Displays selected country
- If using a custom DHIS2 instance, shows the instance URL instead
- Has a log-out button to clear the credentials

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","context-menu.jpeg"))
# library(knitr)
# opts_chunk$set(list(echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE))
```

## Sidebar

The Sidebar is located on the left side of the app and contains the data control for which the data will be downloaded. It contains the following

1. **Data Level**: This is for the level of data to be downloaded. The selected level will be considered to be the admin level 2 by the countdown tab.
2. **Filter by Data Level**: This is meant to filter the data downloaded by a single of multiple organisation units at the selected data level
3. **Period**: This is the period the data will be downloaded
